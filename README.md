# MODFLOW 6 development version of binary executables

The develop branch of the [MODFLOW 6 repository](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6) contains bug fixes and new functionality that may be incorporated into the next [approved MODFLOW 6 release](https://www.usgs.gov/software/modflow-6-usgs-modular-hydrologic-model). Each night, at 2 AM UTC, Fortran source code from the development branch is compiled for Windows, MacOS, and Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS using gfortran. The binary executables released [here](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-nightly-build/releases/latest) represent release candidates for the next approved version of MODFLOW 6 but are considered preliminary or provisional.

The compiled codes for the latest nightly build are available as operating specific [release assets](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-nightly-build/releases/latest) (`win64.zip`, `mac.zip`, and `linux.zip`). Each operating specific release asset includes: 

1. **mf6** (MODFLOW 6)
2. **mf5to6** (the MODFLOW 5 to 6 converter)
3. **zbud6** (the zone budget utility for MODFLOW 6) 
4. **libmf6.dll** or **libmf6.so** (a dynamic-linked library or shared object version of MODFLOW 6)

Each release also includes a copy of the *'MODFLOW 6 â€“ Description of Input and Output'* document (`mf6io.pdf`) for the [latest MODFLOW 6 release candidate](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-nightly-build/releases/latest).

Release tags are based on the date (YYYYMMDD) the MODFLOW 6 codes were compiled and the release was made. Previous nightly build releases are retained for 30 days in the event that there are issues with the latest release candidate.
