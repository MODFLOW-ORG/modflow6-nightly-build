The `develop` branch of the [MODFLOW 6 repository](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6) contains bug fixes and new functionality that may be incorporated into the next [approved MODFLOW 6 release](https://www.usgs.gov/software/modflow-6-usgs-modular-hydrologic-model). Each night, as well as whenever code is merged into the `develop` branch, a workflow runs here to compile MODFLOW 6 with Intel Fortran on `windows-2022`, `macos-12`, and `ubuntu-22.04` runner images. The binaries are then posted as a [release on this repository](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-nightly-build/releases/latest). Binaries posted here are release candidates for the next approved version of MODFLOW 6 but are considered preliminary or provisional.

**Note**: though this repository is named "nightly", a development distribution is created whenever code is merged into the `develop` branch of the MODFLOW 6 repository. If a release has already been created for the current date, assets are updated on the existing release.

## Distribution contents

The nightly builds are available as operating-system specific [release assets](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-nightly-build/releases/latest) (`win64.zip`, `mac.zip`, and `linux.zip`). The distribution includes: 

1. **mf6[.exe]**: MODFLOW 6
2. **mf5to6[.exe]**: the MODFLOW 5 to 6 converter
3. **zbud6[.exe]**: the zone budget utility for MODFLOW 6
4. **libmf6[.dll/so/dylib]**: a dynamic-linked library or shared object version of MODFLOW 6
5. **code.json**: a JSON file containing version information and other metadata

Each release also includes a copy of the *'MODFLOW 6 â€“ Description of Input and Output'* document (`mf6io.pdf`) for the [latest MODFLOW 6 release candidate](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-nightly-build/releases/latest).

Release tags are based on the date, with format `YYYYMMDD`. Nightly builds are retained for 30 days in the event that there are issues with the latest release candidate. 


## Linux compatibility

The Linux binaries are built on Ubuntu 22.04 and may encounter `libc`-related backwards-incompatibilities on earlier versions of Ubuntu or other Linux distributions. The [`MODFLOW-USGS/executables`](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/executables/releases) distribution is built on Ubuntu 20.04 and is known to be compatible with 18.04-22.04.


## Reporting issues

Any issues with the nightly build should be posted on the main [MODFLOW 6 GitHub repo](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6) and flagged with the [nightly build](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6/labels/nightly%20build) label.
