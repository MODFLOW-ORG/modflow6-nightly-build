The develop branch of the [MODFLOW 6 repository](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6) contains bug fixes and new functionality that may be incorporated into the next [approved MODFLOW 6 release](https://www.usgs.gov/software/modflow-6-usgs-modular-hydrologic-model). Each night, Fortran source code from the development branch is compiled on `windows-2022`, `macos-12`, and `ubuntu-22.04` runner images using Intel Fortran. The binary executables released [here](https://github.com/MODFLOW-USGS/modflow6-nightly-build/releases/latest) are release candidates for the next approved version of MODFLOW 6 but are considered preliminary or provisional.
